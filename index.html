<!--
	Instructions:

	1. Create an external style sheet called style.css in the same folder as
	   index.html.
	2. Link to that style sheet in this file using a <link> tag.
	3. Attempt to replicate the style in solution.png using your knowledge
	   of selectors & width/height/margin/padding. Do NOT modify the HTML in
	   the body. Don't worry about getting things *exactly* matching, just
	   try to get in the ballpark.

	There are hints in the body below to help clue you in to what CSS
	properties you need to manipulate.
